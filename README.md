# Hepatitis C Cases in Saudi Arabia: Analysis using SQL


## Queries Overview

### Descriptive Statistics Query
- Computes descriptive statistics such as counts, totals, averages, minimums, maximums, and standard deviations for regions.
- Utilizes SQL aggregation functions (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, `STDDEV`) and clauses (`DISTINCT`) to derive insights into patient distribution across regions.

### Yearly Average and Standard Deviation Query
- Calculates the average and standard deviation for each year (2019-2022) independently.
- Demonstrates proficiency in statistical analysis using SQL aggregation functions (`AVG`, `STDDEV`) and rounding with `ROUND` function for clear presentation.

### Sort the Regions Query
- Retrieves regions sorted based on the total number of patients in descending order.
- Showcases sorting functionality (`ORDER BY`) for organizing data based on specific criteria.

### Retrieve the Number of Regions Query
- Counts the number of distinct regions in the dataset.
- Utilizes SQL function (`COUNT`) with `DISTINCT` keyword for accurate counting of regions.

### Find the Five Regions with the Highest Total Patients Query
- Retrieves the top 5 regions with the highest total number of patients.
- Utilizes clauses (`ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`) for focused analysis of top-performing regions.

### Percentage Change in Patients Query
- Calculates the percentage change in patients' numbers between 2019 and 2022 for each region.
- Utilizes mathematical calculations and conditional logic (`CASE` statement) for insightful comparisons.

### Total Patients for Each Age Group Query
- Aggregates data for each age group and calculates total patients across all years.
- Demonstrates proficiency in data grouping (`GROUP BY`) and summarization using aggregate function (`SUM`).

### Retrieve the Age Groups with the Highest/Lowest Number of Patients Query
- Identifies the age groups with the highest and lowest number of patients for each year (2019-2022).
- Utilizes subqueries and conditional filtering with `WHERE` clause to extract relevant information.

### Total Number of Females and Males Query
- Calculates the total number of females and males across all years.
- Utilizes aggregate function (`SUM`) to aggregate gender data.

### Average Number of Females and Males Query
- Computes the average number of females and males across all years.
- Demonstrates proficiency in using aggregate function (`AVG`) for calculating averages.

### Percentage of Females and Males for Each Year Query
- Calculates the percentage of females and males for each year.
- Utilizes mathematical operations and string concatenation for percentage calculation.
